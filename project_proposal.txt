Introduction
The price of gold plays a crucial role in the global economy, acting as a benchmark for monetary stability and an investment safe haven.
Its value is influenced by various factors such as currency fluctuations, inflation rates, geopolitical tensions, and market sentiment.
Predicting gold prices is a challenging task due to the dynamic and complex nature of these influences.
Machine learning (ML) offers powerful tools to analyze patterns and trends in historical data, 
enabling more accurate forecasting compared to traditional methods.

Problem Statement

Gold price prediction is a vital tool for investors, policymakers, and financial analysts. 
However, existing methods often fail to capture the intricate relationships among the various factors influencing gold prices. 
Traditional statistical models may lack the flexibility to account for non-linear patterns and interdependencies. 
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based approach to address these challenges and improve the accuracy of gold price forecasts.

Goals

To analyze historical data and identify key features influencing gold prices.
To develop and implement machine learning models for gold price prediction.
To compare the performance of various ML models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM) and select the most suitable one.
To provide insights into the relationships between economic indicators and gold prices.
To validate the model on unseen data to ensure generalization and robustness.

Related Work

Numerous studies have explored gold price prediction using machine learning and statistical methods:
Time-Series Models: Traditional approaches like ARIMA and GARCH models have been used for forecasting gold prices but are limited in handling non-linear relationships.
Machine Learning Models: Models like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting have shown improved performance by leveraging advanced feature extraction techniques.
Deep Learning: Neural networks, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have been effective in capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data.
Hybrid Models: Combining machine learning techniques with econometric models has provided better insights and predictions.
This project will build upon these approaches, utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and data engineering practices to achieve improved predictive accuracy.
